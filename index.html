    <h3>What is a digital product?</h3>
    <p> A digital product refers to a product or service that is primarily based on digital technology, existing in a non-physical 
        or intangible form. Unlike traditional physical products, which are tangible and occupy physical space, 
        digital products are created, distributed, and consumed in a digital environment.<br>
        <br>
        This category encompasses a vast arrayof offerings, ranging from software applications and online platforms to multimedia
        content and digital services.<br>
        <br>
        To understand the nature of digital products, it's essential to delve into their characteristics, advantages, and how they
        compare to traditional physical products.<br>
        <br>
        Google Search, Facebook, Uber app, and Sonos speaker app are good examples of digital products. Some exists independently
        while others are a digitized form or part of a physical product or business.<br>
